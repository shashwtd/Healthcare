                <h1>What is Healthcare?</h1>
                <p>
                    Healthcare is maintenance or improvement of your health by prevention or cure of any physical and
                    mental impairments in people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Access to health care may vary across countries, influenced by social and economic conditions as
                    well
                    as health policies. Providing health care services means "the timely use of personal health services
                    to achieve the best possible health outcomes". Factors to consider in terms of health care access
                    include financial limitations (such as insurance coverage), geographic barriers (such as additional
                    transportation costs, the possibility to take paid time off of work to use such services), and
                    personal limitations (lack of ability to communicate with health care providers, poor health
                    literacy, low income). Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical
                    services, the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations.
                    According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a well-functioning health care system requires a
                    financing mechanism, a well-trained and adequately paid workforce, reliable information on which to
                    base decisions and policies, and well-maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and
                    technologies. An efficient health care system can contribute to a significant part of a country's
                    economy, development, and industrialization. Health care is conventionally regarded as an important
                    determinant in promoting the general physical and mental health and well-being of people around the
                    world. An example of this was the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1980, declared by the WHO as
                    the first disease in human history to be eliminated by deliberate health care interventions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The delivery of modern health care depends on groups of trained professionals and paraprofessionals
                    coming together as interdisciplinary teams. This includes professionals in medicine, psychology,
                    physiotherapy, nursing, dentistry, midwifery and allied health, along with many others such as
                    public health practitioner, community health workers and assistive personnel, who systematically
                    provide personal and population-based preventive, curative and rehabilitative care services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the definitions of the various types of health care vary depending on the different cultural,
                    political, organizational, and disciplinary perspectives, there appears to be some consensus that
                    primary care constitutes the first element of a continuing health care process and may also include
                    the provision of secondary and tertiary levels of care. Health care can be defined as either public
                    or private.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A health system, also sometimes referred to as health care system or healthcare system, is the
                    organization of people, institutions, and resources that deliver health care services to populations
                    in need.

                    Healthcare industry
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The healthcare industry incorporates several sectors that are dedicated to providing health care
                    services and products. As a basic framework for defining the sector, the United Nations'
                    International Standard Industrial Classification categorizes health care as generally consisting of
                    hospital activities, medical and dental practice activities, and "other human health activities."
                    The last class involves activities of, or under the supervision of, nurses, midwives,
                    physiotherapists, scientific or diagnostic laboratories, pathology clinics, residential health
                    facilities, patient advocates or other allied health professions.

                <h1 style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom: 20px;">Good Habits!</h1>
                <h2>1) Don’t cut corners. </h2>
                <p>Oftentimes in a moment of high stress or pressure, procedures and rules don’t seem to be as important as finishing something. However, in the healthcare field more than maybe any other career field, it is of the utmost importance that you follow each procedure and all protocol for your facility. Not only does this help ensure your own safety, it also keeps your coworkers and patients safe. What seems like it may cost time in the moment will likely end up saving time and extra work in the long run. </p>
                <h2>2) Always keep learning. </h2>
                <p>Even after you complete your healthcare training program, you will still have a lot to learn about your field and especially about the facility you are working in. A successful healthcare professional knows that a little humility will go a long way. They are always looking to learn new and better ways to do things. Being willing to learn a new way or new procedure is impressive to managers and coworkers alike and makes you able to become better and better at your job. </p>
                <h2>3) Be on time.</h2>
                <p>This one may seem obvious, but in the healthcare field it is more important than ever to make sure that you are on time. There are other healthcare professionals and your patients that are depending on you coming to work on time and ready to jump right in. Although sometimes your presence may mean life or death, it’s more likely that you will be responsible for patients, charts, or billing that you may be the expert on and the staff being on time ensures that the office or hospital can continue to run smoothly. Come rain or snow or sun, get to work and get there on time! </p>
                <h2>4) Don’t rush. </h2>
                <p>Your shift may be over, or your lunch may be starting, but patient care and the office as a whole must come first. No matter what, highly effective healthcare professionals take their time, pay attention to all the details, and make sure that they are thorough and accurate. Rushing a situation may save a few minutes, but may cost much more in the long run. </p>
                <h2>5) Be available. </h2>
                <p>The best healthcare professionals work hard to be flexible and support the team. If someone needs a shift covered and you are available, volunteer to take it! If your manager needs someone to come in a little early or stay a little late, try to make that happen. Being flexible and available helps to increase trust and build a teamwork atmosphere. It also makes you stand out as someone who can be depended upon. </p>

                <h1>The worst pandemic! </h1>
                <p>
                    Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory
                    syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in
                    December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing
                    difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after
                    exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable
                    symptoms. Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most
                    (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms,
                    and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction). Older
                    people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a
                    range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.
                    Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles
                    containing the virus. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity,
                    but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if
                    splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids in the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via
                    contaminated surfaces. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if
                    they do not develop symptoms.
                </p>
                <p>Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method
                    is by detection of the virus's nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain
                    reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription
                    loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab.

                </p>
                <p>Several COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and distributed in various countries, which have
                    initiated mass vaccination campaigns. Other preventive measures include physical or social
                    distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing,
                    and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of face masks or coverings has been
                    recommended in public settings to minimize the risk of transmission. While work is underway to
                    develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. Management involves the
                    treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.</p>
